# Login-page
I created a Login-signup web Application using Django framework, Mysql and Basics of HTML,CSS and Js,  which will first ask you to enter your details to login.
After you enter the password , it will check its database if the password enter for the co-oresponding Email is correct or not.
If it is  wrong then it will ask you to re-enter correct password. If you have not registered and trying to login then it will take you to the our signup page
and ask you to first register yourself. 
The data registered on our signup-page will be stored in our database and it will ensure that same Email is not used again and agai  to register.
 After sign-up is completed you can login using the same details.
